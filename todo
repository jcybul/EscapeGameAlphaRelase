Todo for alpha release


CREATE ALL TYPES OF COORDINATES
  1. Square coordinate distance test:

	(1,1)->(2,2) 1  
	(1,2)->(3,5) 3 
	
	
  2. Hexagonal Coordinates:
  	(0,0)->(-1,2)  2 
  	(-1,2)->(2,-2) 4
  	(-1,-1)->(1,1) 4
  	(-1,-1)->(2,0) 4
  	
  
  
  3. Orthogonal Coordinates:
  	(1,1)->(2,2) 2
  	(1,2->(3,5) 5
  	(7,8)->(4,3) 8
  4. throw exception when comparing two different coordinate types
  Square with orthoSquare -> exception
  Orthosquare with hex -> exception
  hex with Square   -> exceptionc
  
 
 
 
CREATE A SQUARE BOARD FROM FILE 

TEST:													    RETURN:
CREATE A SQUARE  BOARD WITH ALL THE APROPIATE VALUES		GOOD
	initialize a board with some pieces from file
	get piece that was placed at 2,2
	the piece is a horse and placed by player 1
	
	acces a cordinate outside of the size of the board 
		1.one for less than 1 
		2.one for more than the max
	
	place a piece on a exit position check is empty
	
	place a piece on a blocked positon -> exception
	
	when a null pieces is passed and a piece was 
	at given coordinate remove the piece
	
	catch exception when coordinate is out of bounds
	for any of the given fuctions that use it
	
	



CREATE A HEX BOARD FROM FILE
	initilize board with piece from file 
	get piece that was placed at 2,2
	the piece is a horse and placed by player 1
	
	getInfo from large coordinates to "prove infinity"
	
	place a piece on a exit position and then check that is null 
	
	place a piece on a blocked positon
	
	place a piece on a undeclared postion from file that should be clear

	when a null pieces is passed and a piece was 
	at given coordinate remove the piece
	

CREATE AN ORTHO BOARD FROM FIlE
	initilize board with piece from file 
	get piece that was placed at 2,2
	the piece is a horse and placed by player 1
	
	acces a cordinate outside of the size of the board 
		1.one for less than 1 
		2.one for more than the max
	
	place a piece on a exit position and then check that is null 
	
	place a piece on a blocked positon
	
	when a null pieces is passed and a piece was 
	at given coordinate remove the piece
	
	catch exception when coordinate is out of bounds
	for any of the given fuctions that use it
	


make a board whit an unknown coordinate type                Null
