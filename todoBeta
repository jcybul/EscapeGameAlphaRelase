TDD for beta Release 
initilize a board from file with the given pieces set correctly




1. have a piece move a distance larger than it is allowed:
		
Linear movement test:
		
	SquareBoard:
	
	move Linear manner to any direction:
	diagonal:   frog(5,5)->(2,2)    True
	orthogonal: frog(5,5)->(5,1)    True
	random:     frog(5,5)->(8,3)    False
	
	Distance more than allowed
	frog(5,5)->(5,11) allowed 5 current 6   False
	
	Landing on a Blocked postion
	
	ORTHO
	
		Jump over one piece 
		frog(5,5)->(2,5) piece at 3,5   	    True
		
		jump over to pieces 
		frog(3,5)->(3,2) two pieces in between  False
		
		fly over two pieces
		horse(7,4)->(7,1) two pieces in between True 
		
		blocked test 
		
		piece that has unblock capabilities 
		fox(1,5)->(1,2) block at (1,4)  true
		
		fly over blocked positon 
		horse(4,8)->(1,8) block at 3,8 true 
		
		land on block space                        
		horse(4,8)->(3,8)						false

	DIOGANAL:
		
		Jump over one piece
		frog(5,3)->(3,1) piece at 4,2              true 
		
		jump over two pieces
		frog(5,8)->(2,5) two pieces in between     False
		 
		fly over two pieces
		horse(8,7)->(11,4) two pieces in between   true
		
		piece that has unblock capabilities
		fox(8,2)->(10,4) block at (9,3)            true 
	
		fly over Blocked postion
		horse(10,6)->(13,9) block at(12,)      true 
	
Diagonal movement pattern:


	diagonal linear 
		move in clear diagonal all for directions:
		frog(5,5)->(7,3)   true 
		frog(5,5)->(3,3)   true
		frog(5,5)->(3,7)   true 
		frog(5,5)->(7,7)   true 
		
		none diagonal way:
		(7,8)->(4,9) false
		
		jump over one piece in each direction 
		frog(10,5)->(12,7)   true 
		frog(10,5)->(12,3)   true 
		frog(10,5)->(8,7)   true 
		frog(10,5)->(8,3)   true 
		
		jump over two pieces 
		frog(2,1)->(5,4) two pieces in between   false
		
		fly over two pieces
		Horse(5,6)->(8,9)               true 
		
		Piece that has unblock capabilities
		fox(3,5)->(1,7) block ar 2,6    true 
		
		Fly over Blocked Position
		(10,9)->(12,11)  block at 11,1 true 
		
		Jump over to none consecutive pieces 
		(13,8)->(18,13) pieces at (15,1) and (17,12)
	diagonal linear 
	
	diagonal with direction changes:
	
	jump over one piece then change direction
	(9,15)->(12,14) block at (10,16) piece at (10,14)
	
	
	
		
		
Ortho movement pattern: 
	
	path find ortho
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
Omni movemet pattern:

	path finding test:
	Piece at (2,8)-> (5,8) true in 4 moves no flying no unblocking
	three blocks in the way at 
	(3,8),(4,8),(4,7)
	
	
	unblock path find 
	(3,16)->(5,16) block at 4,15 and 4,16 and 4,17 
	
	No path because is surrounded by blocks 
	pieces at (17,14)     false 
	
	No Path distance more than allowed 
	Piece at (11,6)->(16,6)
	
	Jump outside a box of pieces
	piece at(11,14)->(11,12) surrounded by 8 pieces true 
	
	jump two none consecutive pieces
	block at to prevent other paths (3,1)(3,3)
	(2,2)->(6,2)  pieces at (3,2) and (5,2)   true 
	
	jump over two consectuive pieces 
	block at (4,11) and (4,13) 
	(3,12)->(7,12) pieces at (4,12) and (5,12)false 
	
	Fly over two pieces
	(8,7)->(8,4)      true
